Lives are lost, infrastructure is destroyed, the social fabric is torn apart, and people are left with physical and psychological trauma. In the aftermath of a disaster, communities begin the collective process of healing, grieving losses, repairing damage, and adapting to a new reality. Previous work has suggested the existence of a series of prototypical stages through which such community responses evolve. As social media have become more widely used, affected communities have increasingly adopted them to express, navigate, and build their response due to the greater visibility and speed of interaction that these platforms afford. In this study, we ask if the behavior of disaster-struck communities on social media follows prototypicalpatterns and what relationship, if any, these patterns may have with those established for offline behavior in previous work. Building on theoretical models of disaster response, we investigate whether, in the short term, community responses on social media in the aftermath of disasters follow a prototypical trajectory. We conduct our analysis using computational methods to model over 200 disaster-stricken U.S. communities. Community responses are measured in a range of domains, including psychological, social, and sense-making, and as multidimensional time series derived from the linguistic markers in tweets from those communities. We find that community responses on Twitter demonstrate similar response patterns across numerous social, aspirational, and physical dynamics. Additionally, through cluster analysis, we demonstrate that a minority of communities are characterized by more intense and enduring emotional coping strategies and sense-making. In this investigation of the relationship between community response and intrinsic properties of disasters, we reveal that the severity of the impact makes the deviant trajectory more likely, while the type and duration of a disaster are not associated with it.","tags":[],"title":"Pulling through together: social media response trajectories in disaster‑stricken communities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julie Jiang","Danaja Maldeniya","Kristina Lerman","Emilio Ferrara"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609477200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609477200,"objectID":"e4c72b9a3b3a0496b893dbffd476b283","permalink":"https://danaja.github.io/publication/the-wide-the-deep-the-maverick/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/the-wide-the-deep-the-maverick/","section":"publication","summary":"Although player performance in online games has been widely studied, few studies have considered thebehavioral preferences of players and how that impacts performance. In a competitive setting where playersmust cooperate with temporary teammates, it is even more crucial to understand how differences in playingstyle contribute to teamwork. Drawing on theories of individual behavior in teams, we describe a methodologyto empirically profile players based on the diversity and conformity of their gameplay styles. Applying thisapproach to a League of Legends dataset, we find three distinct types of players that align with our theoreticalframework:generalists,specialists, andmavericks. Importantly, the behavior of each player type remainsstable despite players becoming more experienced. Additionally, we extensively investigate the benefits anddrawbacks of each type of player by evaluating their individual performance, contribution to the team, andadaptation to changes in the game environment. We find that, overall, specialists tend to outperform others,while mavericks bear high risk but also potentially reap great rewards. Generalists are the most resilient toinstability in the environment (game patches). We discuss the implications of these findings in terms of gamedesign and community management, as well as team building in environments with varying levels of stability.","tags":["diversity","conformity","teams","online-games","shocks"],"title":"The Wide, the Deep, and the Maverick: Types of Players in Team-based Online Games","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Danaja Maldeniya","Ceren Budak","Lionel P.

Thestructure and operation of these virtual and loosely-knit teams dif-fer from traditional organizations. As such, little is known about how their behavior may change in response to an increase in external attention. To understand these dynamics, we analyze millions of actions of thousands of contributors in over 1100 open source software projects that topped the GitHub Trending Projects page and thus experienced a large increase in attention, in comparison to a control group of projects identified through propensity score matching. In carrying out our research, we use the lens of organizational change, which considers the challenges teams face during rapid growth and how they adapt their work routines, organizational structure, and management style. We show that trending results in an explosive growth in the effective team size. However, most newcomers make only shallow and transient contributions. In response, the original team transitions towards administrative roles, responding to requests and reviewing work done by newcomers. Projects evolve towards a more distributed coordination model withnewcomers becoming more central, albeit in limited ways. Additionally, teams become more modular with subgroups specializing in different aspects of the project. We discuss broader implicationsfor collaborative crowdsourcing teams that face attention shocks.","tags":[],"title":"Herding a Deluge of Good Samaritans: How GitHub Projects Respond to Increased Attention","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joshua Blumenstock","Danaja Maldeniya","Sriganesh Lokanathan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1509508800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509508800,"objectID":"87274d9c2cd686c247c29c3932da26cf","permalink":"https://danaja.github.io/publication/impact-of-urban-infrastructure/","publishdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/impact-of-urban-infrastructure/","section":"publication","summary":"As a growing share of the world’s population inhabits cities, a central focus of current development policy has been on building urban infrastructure to support increasing population density. An important component of such policy has been the construction of major roads and highways, which in principle can reduce congestion, promote development of peri-urban areas, and increase labor mobility. However, the actual impacts of such investments have been difficult to evaluate empirically. Here, we use a rich dataset capturing the mobility patterns of roughly 9 million individuals to study the impact of a new super-highway on travel patterns in and around Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Our results indicate that this road had an immediate and pronounced impact on travel patterns: people changed their primary routes of travel, which reduced overall congestion, increased average travel speeds, and reduced the amount of time spent in transit. We further find that the super-highway led to a modest, but statistically significant, increase in the total amount of travel in and around Colombo. We discuss how such insights can inform future policymaking, and point to several promising areas for future research.","tags":["urban informatics","shocks","mobility"],"title":"Understanding the Impact of Urban Infrastructure: New Insights from Population-Scale Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Danaja Maldeniya","Arun Varghese","Toby Stuart","Daniel M.

Member profiles provide an opportunity for candidates to present information about themselves that their counterparts use to assess compatibility and desirability. In this paper, we explore how text-based similarities among users of a dating site impact their success in attracting attention. The principle of homophily predicts that to be successful, a user should be perceived as similar to the person they would prefer to date. Conversely, theories of distinctiveness suggest that standing out from the crowd should be beneficial. Using profiles, we explore how the text similarity between a user, the opposite-sex member they are targeting, and their same-sex competitors impacts the likelihood that a sender of a message receives a response conditional on initiating contact. We find that the probability of receiving a response is maximized when the user has high text similarity to the person they message, but low text similarity to the competitors that are also seeking the same individual’s attention. This suggests a balance between homophily and distinctiveness theory.","tags":["online dating","choice","homophily","self-presentation"],"title":"The Role of Optimal Distinctiveness and Homophily in Online Dating","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rohan Samarajiva","Sriganesh Lokanathan","Kaushalya Madhawa","Gabriel Kriendler","Danaja Maldeniya"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1432958400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1432958400,"objectID":"ca653f72a56202dc2823186b3e8fb2db","permalink":"https://danaja.github.io/publication/big-data-to-improve-urban-planning/","publishdate":"2015-05-30T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/big-data-to-improve-urban-planning/","section":"publication","summary":"Data analytics is a frontier field where the tools and techniques are still being developed.
