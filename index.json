Member profiles provide an opportunity for candidates to present information about themselves that their counterparts use to assess compatibility and desirability. In this paper, we explore how text-based similarities among users of a dating site impact their success in attracting attention. The principle of homophily predicts that to be successful, a user should be perceived as similar to the person they would prefer to date. Conversely, theories of distinctiveness suggest that standing out from the crowd should be beneficial. Using profiles, we explore how the text similarity between a user, the opposite-sex member they are targeting, and their same-sex competitors impacts the likelihood that a sender of a message receives a response conditional on initiating contact. We find that the probability of receiving a response is maximized when the user has high text similarity to the person they message, but low text similarity to the competitors that are also seeking the same individual’s attention. This suggests a balance between homophily and distinctiveness theory.","tags":[],"title":"The Role of Optimal Distinctiveness and Homophily in Online Dating","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joshua Blumenstock","Danaja Maldeniya","Sriganesh Lokanathan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483246800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483246800,"objectID":"87274d9c2cd686c247c29c3932da26cf","permalink":"https://danaja.github.io/publication/impact-of-urban-infrastructure/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/impact-of-urban-infrastructure/","section":"publication","summary":"As a growing share of the world’s population inhabits cities, a central focus of current development policy has been on building urban infrastructure to support increasing population density. An important component of such policy has been the construction of major roads and highways, which in principle can reduce congestion, promote development of peri-urban areas, and increase labor mobility. However, the actual impacts of such investments have been difficult to evaluate empirically. Here, we use a rich dataset capturing the mobility patterns of roughly 9 million individuals to study the impact of a new super-highway on travel patterns in and around Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Our results indicate that this road had an immediate and pronounced impact on travel patterns: people changed their primary routes of travel, which reduced overall congestion, increased average travel speeds, and reduced the amount of time spent in transit. We further fi\u001bnd that the super-highway led to a modest, but statistically signifi\u001bcant, increase in the total amount of travel in and around Colombo. We discuss how such insights can inform future policymaking, and point to several promising areas for future research.","tags":[],"title":"Understanding the Impact of Urban Infrastructure: New Insights from Population-Scale Data","type":"publication"}]
